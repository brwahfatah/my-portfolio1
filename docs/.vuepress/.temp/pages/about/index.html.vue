<p>I started my coding journey with curiosity and a drive to create. Over the years, I’ve honed my skills in front-end development, especially with frameworks like <strong>Vue.js</strong> and tools like <strong>VuePress</strong>, which I use to craft fast, elegant static sites like this portfolio.</p>
