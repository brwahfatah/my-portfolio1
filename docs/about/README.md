# About Me

Hi, I'm **Brwa Hawar** — a passionate web developer and digital creator based in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. I specialize in building modern, responsive websites and applications that blend clean design with powerful functionality.

## 👨‍💻 My Journey

I started my coding journey with curiosity and a drive to create. Over the years, I’ve honed my skills in front-end development, especially with frameworks like **Vue.js** and tools like **VuePress**, which I use to craft fast, elegant static sites like this portfolio.

## 💡 What I Love

- Turning ideas into interactive web experiences.
- Writing clean, maintainable code.
- Exploring new technologies and design trends.
- Collaborating with others to bring creative visions to life.

## 🎯 My Mission

To build digital products that are not only functional but also delightful to use. Whether it's a personal project or a client website, I aim to deliver work that reflects quality, creativity, and attention to detail.

## 🌐 Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, you’ll find me exploring design tools, learning new skills, or enjoying the vibrant culture of Kurdistan. I believe technology should empower people — and I’m here to be part of that movement.
